#Austin Tumbey


Hello, my name is Austin Tumbey. I am a second-year student at the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire majoring in Computer Science.

This is my first year taking a coding course, but I have some experience learning programming concepts and writing basic code. Although I am still building my project experience, I enjoy understanding how code works and improving my problem-solving skills.

I am eager to continue developing my abilities and want to learn more about Java, Python, and other programming languages to become a stronger and more versatile developer.

This website was created using GitHub Pages to practice my GitHub skills and to build a public portfolio that showcases my growth to employers, professors, and anyone interested in my programming journey.

I am currently building skills in:
- HTML & CSS
- Python
- JavaScript
- SQL and Database Design
- Git & GitHub
